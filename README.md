## Road map

- **Implement role-based access control**: Admins can manage all tasks, while regular users can only manage their own tasks (You can use libraries like NextAuth).
- **Sort and filter tasks**: A page that displays tables that show the list of tasks something like Trello. The user should be able to modify and delete.
- **Create data table**: The table should have some functionality such as sorting and filters.
- **Unit tests**: Write tests fo backend and frontend.
- **Drag and Drop**: Use drag and drop to move the tasks.
